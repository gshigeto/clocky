# Clocky

An Ionic 2 application that clocks you in and out that is compatible with Google Sheets.

## Developing

You need to have the Ionic CLI and TypeScript installed to develop this application:

```shell
$ npm install -g ionic typescript
```

Once you've cloned the project, simply run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

To serve the project, run `ionic serve` or `ionic serve --lab` to serve all three platforms side-by-side.
